        <td>Family time is foremost in everything I do. With two children under 4 years old, we're kept very busy by their vibrant energy and all our activities are focused around them. Anything from going to the park, indoor play areas, the beach, or playing at home on rainy days.</td>

        <td><strong>Reading</strong></td>
        <td>My book collection consists mostly of biographies and self-help/improvement books. Some of my favourite types of books include research findings of things science doesn't have an answer for, such as Paranormal, Mysteries and such. Although I'm not a big fan of fiction works, if I start reading a story, I can get into it. My worst habit concerning reading is that I put a book down and don't pick it up again for months or even years!</td>

      <td><strong>Driving</strong></td>
      <td>Many people don't consider driving as much of a hobby, but what better way to spend a day, behind the wheel of your own vehicle, exploring new places, coffee shops, scenery, etc, or just having some time alone to wind down. I'm an avid fan of sports cars and like to spend time driving my 2005 350z. When things start getting stressful, I have a favourite spot I like to drive to where I can wind down with a beverage and the views.</td>

      <td>As a self-taught programmer/coder, I spend some of my alone time trying to keep up-to-date with the latest coding trends, learning or improving skills I've studied so far and even some image design work. I'm currently studying two courses online - Full Stack Engineering and Python.</td>
